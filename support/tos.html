            <p>These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate

            <h2>Section 22</h2>
            <h3>Governing Law and Arbitration:</h3>
            <p><strong>Governing Law.</strong> Disputes with the Terms of Service, Terms of Sale, Privacy Policy, and
                any claims relating to or arising in connection with the Service or sale or products (hereinafter
                “Disputes”), will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, United
                States of America, without regard to its choice or conflict of law principles. Further, you and Warren
                James agree that any Dispute, or claim that relates to or arises in connection with a Dispute, that is
                not subject to mandatory arbitration under this Section shall be brought solely in the state or federal
                courts located in Austin, Texas. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such
                courts and waive any defense of forum inconvenience in connection therewith.</p>
            <p><strong>Arbitration.</strong> You and Warren James each agree that any Dispute or claim that relates to
                or arises in connection with a Dispute, will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class)
                arbitration. You and Warren James further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to
                rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or
                validity of this Section or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more
                informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN
                ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must
                follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court, except that the arbitrator
                may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties
                to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the provision above, you and Warren James both agree that nothing in this Section will be
                deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an
                individual action in a U.S. small claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary
                or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the
                arbitrator. In addition, this Section does not prevent you or us from bringing issues to the attention
                of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on
                your behalf (or vice versa).</p>
            <p>Any arbitration between you and Warren James will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the
                American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Section.
                You and Warren James agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and
                enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as
                instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call
                the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>
            <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration hereunder must first send a written notice of the dispute to the
                other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event
                that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Warren James’s
                address for Notice is: 2804 SOUTH 1ST STREET, #1110, AUSTIN, TX 78704. The Notice must (1) describe the
                nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We
                agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do
                so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Warren James may commence an arbitration
                proceeding. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept
                strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than
                for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not
                be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by
                applicable law.</p>
