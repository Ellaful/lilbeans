        <section>
            <h2>Notice for U.S. Customers</h2>
            <p>Due to recent shifts in the import/export landscape in the USA, your order may experience delays during
                Customs Clearance. Regrettably, this is beyond the control of both us and our shipping partners. For
                updates on your order, please contact our customer service team at <a
                    href="mailto:customersupport@warrenjames.org">customersupport@warrenjames.org</a>. We appreciate
                your understanding and patience as we adapt to these ongoing changes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Terms of Sale</h2>
            <p>By placing an order with Warren James, Inc (“Warren James”), you are (i) offering to purchase a product,
                (ii) representing that you are of legal age to form a binding contract, and (iii) representing that all
                information you provide to us in connection with such order is true and accurate and you are an
                authorized user of the payment method provided. The receipt by you of an order confirmation does not
                constitute Warren James’s acceptance of an order. We retain the right to refuse any request made by you.
            </p>
            <p>Prior to Warren James’s acceptance of an order, verification of information may be required. Warren James
                reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order, or any
                portion thereof, even after your receipt of an order confirmation from Warren James, for any reason
                whatsoever. Warren James reserves the right to limit the number of items ordered and to refuse service
                to you without prior notification. In the event that an item lists an incorrect price, either due to
                typographical or other error, Warren James shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such order
                placed for the incorrect price, regardless of whether the order is being or has been processed. If
                payment has already been made or if your account has already been charged for the purchase and the order
                is canceled, Warren James shall credit your account in the amount of the incorrect price.</p>
            <p>The risk of loss and title for product(s) purchased by you pass to you upon our delivery of the
                product(s) to the carrier.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Exchange / Refund Policy</h2>
            <h3>Refunds or Exchanges:</h3>
            <p><strong>Preorder Period Refunds:</strong> No worries! You can totally get a refund during the open
                preorder period. Just shoot us an email at <a
                    href="mailto:customersupport@warrenjames.org">customersupport@warrenjames.org</a>, and we’ll take
                care of it. Once the preorder period closes, refunds won’t be available, so don’t wait too long!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Damaged or Defective Items:</h3>
            <p>Oh no! If your item arrives damaged or defective (which is super rare, but it happens), let us know
                within 21 days of delivery. Make sure the item is unworn, unwashed, and in its original condition with
                all tags and packaging intact. We’ll check it out and, if everything checks out, hook you up with a
                replacement, repair, or refund (depending on what’s available). Once your claim is processed, we’ll let
                you know what to do with the damaged item.</p>
            <p>All refunds will go back to your original payment method—easy peasy!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Order Modifications:</h3>
            <p>Need to tweak your order? We get it! Once an order is placed, changes (like shipping address or payment
                method) can’t always be guaranteed. But if it’s a preorder and the window is still open, we’ll do our
                best to help you out. Just reach out to us ASAP, and we’ll try to make it happen!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Cancellations by the Seller:</h3>
            <p>In the unlikely event that we are unable to fulfill your order, you will be notified promptly and issued
                a full refund or store credit, depending on your preference.</p>
